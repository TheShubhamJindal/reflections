Prompt : What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is created. 
We need to do this so that we can begin to use git on that repository. 
This .git file stores our log.



Prompt : How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A staging area is a sort of a buffer. It keeps track of the files to be added to a commit. 
A repository is a collection of files being tracked by git, while a wd contains all the files. 
If we don't need to add all the files in a single commit, we can add only the required files to the staging area, which are then committed.
