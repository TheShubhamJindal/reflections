Prompt : When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I'll prefer to use a remote repository instead of a local one, when I have a multiuser team working together.
Also, it would be helpful when I have multiple machines on which I do my work.



Prompt : Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

When working on a team process, I may not require the changes immediately. 
As a result, it is better to have manual sync.
